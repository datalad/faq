> Frequently Asked Questions

This repository was "deprecated" in favor of just containing all questions, including frequently asked ones, withing the [main DataLad github repository](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues).
Please ask your question in an [DataLad Issues](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues). Make sure to search existing issues, as your question may already have been asked and answered.  The FAQs have `FAQ` label attached.

## Usage

#### Comment!

We hope that this FAQ would help answering a lot of questions, and it might become difficult for the DataLad team to go through the backlog and refine answers for older questions. If you think a question hasn't been answered adequately, comment on it, and we'll look at it. Unlike on the rest of GitHub, using :thumb: or '+1' is actively encouraged as a way to show that a question should be brought back to our attention.

#### Use "WIP" in the question title to denote a "Work In Progress" answer.

We will mark any Q/As with `WIP` when the answer is long, complex, and likely to evolve over time. It is very important to signal when we think something is roughly "a final answer", versus "a place to jot down notes and point others for quick disambiguation". Many answers, like comparisons to other systems, will be WIPs for a while.

#### Rendering to a page

The "best" questions and answers will later be compiled into a webpage rendered at http://docs.datalad.org (still TODO)

## Contribute

Feel free to join in and ask or answer questions in the issues. No helpful comment is too small, no answer too big.
